Let me start off by saying that I am still 1 day behind at this point because of the events that took place on the first real night.  The cluster feeding thing kept me up so long that I never had time to actually sit down and write anything at all.  I am one for late nights, but that was crazy.  To have to go all night, sleep for only about 2 hours, get up and play good host followed by staying up till 5am the next day... I have finally met my match.

I can actually say now that I understand why parents fall into the old person rhythm and go to bed so early.  

So let's talk about what day 3 (technically only my daughter's 2nd day) actually included...<!--more-->

So day 2 really the roughest part.  During the daytime after the crazy night, we had a huge host of visitors.  It started off early as my wife's college roommate and her mom (who worked at that hospital) ended up stopping by to see us.  They were nice and it was fun, but it was still early.  We had nurses and doctors stopping by several times throughout the day.  My mother stopped by around lunch time.  My small group buddies also managed to make it to the hospital during the day as well as our long time beaufort friends.  It got to the point where we even had to turn our pastor and his wife away just because we were completely worn out.  People who happened to be in the hospital still decided to stop by, but we were ready to just wind down.  When we finally called it quits, the clock read 11:45pm.  Exhaustion is an understatement.  We sort of assumed that our daughter would sleep the same way she did the night before (i.e. not really at all).  Somehow though, God intervened and helped us out.  She started adhering to a reasonable schedule.  Our daughter would wake up every 3 hours, feed for 20 minutes, have a diaper change, and then go back to sleep.  This let us get our sleep, even if it was for only 2 to 3 hours at a time.  

Things were starting to look up for the newest Clossman "Family" and we were actually making progress. On a better note, the doctors told us that my wife was doing so well after the C-section surgery that she was going to be discharged the next day.

The next day started similar to the one before, we got up and got ready.  The doctor told us we were set for paperwork and then could leave the hospital.  We cleaned, sent Charlotte for her final checkups, showered, changed, and loaded out.  We said goodbye to all of the friendly members of the hospital staff and headed out the door.  We were excited about the prospect of finally being home.  When we got in the car, things were still going good.  My daughter was quiet in the car seat and we were headed back home.  All of a sudden, we realized that my mother in law still had the check for our car that had been in the shop for 2 weeks and needed to give it to my father in law at work in order for him to be able to pick it up later.  This meant we had to turn around our car to head back to my father in law's school.  His office staff came out to see the new addition to the family and coo at the sight.  The baby played fine the whole time but really wasn't pleased with all of the attention (or was already getting hungry again).

She cried and screamed the whole way home.  It was tough.  I had to completely tune her cries out for 30 whole minutes while driving.  She was all the way in the back in her car seat with my wife, but I felt stranded.  I am almost positive that this is a skill that improves over time.  At this point though, being a brand spanking new father, this is one talent that I am still training on.  Whenever she starts crying, she immediately gets all of my attention and care.  When I finally got her home, my wife took her upstairs to get her fed.  My mom, youngest brother, and aunt all stopped by to see her.  My pastor and his wife even stopped by for a bit.  Still a lot to take in, but at least now my wife and I were in familiar territory and had the place set up for ourselves.  

We went to bed with the highest hopes and the best intentions.  The night actually started off well and the baby made things smoothly on nearly the same feeding schedule.  I started believing that this was actually happening correctly and that we were doing the right things.  

Thanks God for giving me this amazing baby girl.  Thanks for making this family thing start to click.  Thanks for giving me extended family on both sides that support us.  Thanks for everything.  Please keep making me strong and help me work for the benefit of my family.  Help me to bridge the distance between my families with my incredible little girl.  Help me to be the father you've planned for me to be and help me to show my daughter the love Christ has for me.

Amen
