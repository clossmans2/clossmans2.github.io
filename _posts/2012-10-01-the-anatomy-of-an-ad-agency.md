So four years of working my tail end off to get a $30k+ piece of paper that says I have a Bachelor of Science degree from an accredited university and I still haven't been able to use anything I learned. This economy is so sad. Anyways, all that being said, I have never had the opportunity to work for an ad agency. In school we always talked about what it would be like working with the creatives as an account manager. Then I check out Mad Men on AMC and it made me long for that sweet stress of impending deadlines surrounding the sale of ideas to clients. When trying to explain what I could do with my degree to my parents, I always get a reaction like "there are really people who do that?" BFG down here in Bluffton, SC (basically my back yard) posted this info-graphic this morning from Big Orange Slide. From what I remember in school just dealing with these specific people on projects, its the most accurate portrayal of an agency that I have seen. Check it out!
