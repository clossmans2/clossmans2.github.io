During the first year of my marriage, my wife said something that I've had a hard time shaking off for so long.  I started thinking about then and up until now, I believed that it was a problem I had.  She said "You'll never be satisfied with what you have<!--more--> or how things are, you're constantly looking for change."  I thought that I had contracted the Clossman curse.

My father is now 50 years old.  He's not ancient by any means, but half a century is getting up there.  He acts and looks like he's 35.  Anyways, growing up I remember that my Dad was continuously trying out new things.  He would start one hobby and go to the next.  He's always been big into fitness but I saw those as personal goals rather than hobbies.  The man has his private pilot's license, SCUBA certification, a near US National Championship in archery (compound bow), a talent for creating things from scratch, and a proclivity for DIY projects.  He needed to prepare for the <a href="http://www.spartanrace.com/spartan-beast-obstacle-course-race.html" title="Spartan Beast" target="_blank">Spartan Beast</a> race last year.  Instead of going to the local YMCA or joining a gym like normal people would, he created his own obstacle course in his backyard.  He had everything from a climbing wall he built onto the shed, a climbing rope that he tied on to one of the tallest trees we have, to a tractor tire flipping zone.  It was intense!  I remember this kind of thing from him all the while.  I needed a science fair project.  He sat down with me and built a listening dish (like they use on the side of a football field) out of things lying around the house.

My football coach needed a new machine for the weight room that was going to cost $1000+ that he talked with my dad about.  My dad built it out of steel and a few welds for $50 and put his name on the side of the side of so that it would forever be known as the Iron Dan machine.  

He's always been a problem and solution guy.  When he started his current job, his main goal was to improve upon the way things were working and to take current resources and change them to produce products that fit the customer's needs.  It's his groove.  I think it must run in the family.

I feel like I have that bug, but in a more technological format.  He worked with CAD and steel, I work with code and user interface.  My job is technically an analyst position, but more often than not I feel myself being drawn toward and working hardest on things that are challenging and involve a bit of design engineering.  

When I look at my hobby habit, I feel like people see it as dissatisfaction with the way things are.  I think people may view me as unhappy.  In fact, the opposite is true.  It would be hard for me to be any happier than I currently am.  I'm married to an awesome woman.  I have a place to live, reliable transportation, a challenging yet occasionally rewarding job, and a solid support network of friends and family.  Add to that the fact that I will be a father soon and you have a pretty bang-up life.  It's not dissatisfaction.  It's very simply about design.

I read <a href="http://hackdesign.org/link/were-not-unhappy-were-designers/" title="this article" target="_blank">this article</a> today when <a href="http://hackdesign.org" title="Hack Design" target="_blank">Hack Design</a> sent it to my inbox.  It makes a lot of sense.  If you have time, give it a read.

In short, my mind is focused on improvement.  People seem to see my want to improve everything I deal with as a sign that I'm unhappy about my life. I am very happy with my life.  The truth is as that article said...

<blockquote>Our discontent is the basis for wanting to improve the things we observe.</blockquote>

My wife will probably try to strangle me some day for it, but when I hear people talk about problems, potential solutions to those problems pop into my head.  More times than not, I let them out.  It's not that I think anything is bad.  I just always see a need for improvement in everything and everyone, especially myself.  I feel that if it was me, I'd want someone to tell me how I could make an improvement on myself, so I follow the "do unto others" rule.  What can I say?  The curse of creativity strikes when I least expect it.  How am I supposed to refine it unless I let it out every once in a while.  Sorry to those that get hit with those bad ideas and are offended in the process.  I'm just trying to help. :)
