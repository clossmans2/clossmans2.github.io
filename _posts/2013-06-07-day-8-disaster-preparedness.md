She mentioned that preparing for a hurricane was a difficult process, but that it made her care more about relationships than possessions.  She said that they knew they could only take what would fit in their car.  That meant that a family of 4 could only take the things that mattered most to them.

In a mental preparedness measure/critical thinking question (not really critical thinking, just a thought exercise),  I posed the following scenario to consider:

<!--more-->

"There is a hurricane bearing down on the next state over or is just off the shore of your current residence.  In 3 hours, it will be too late to leave.  It takes exactly 1 hour to get out the hurricanes way.  You pull into your house and have exactly 2 hours to pack up whatever you want to take with you.  You have 1 mid-size SUV and 1 large king cab truck.  Out of your current belongings, what do you pack in your cars?"

My wife's answer was one that I would expect.  She said that she would take objects that carried some sort of sentimental value.  Things like all the pictures in our house.  This would include everything currently hanging on the walls, all the pictures that have been printed out and stored in albums, and the mass of pictures that have been framed but are being stored in one of our ottomans.  She also included our keepsake boxes, jewelry that had been passed down from her parents and grandparents, and all of her stuffed animals that she's had since she was much younger.  These items have strong emotional experiences attached to them for her. 

We both agreed that we would pack up everything we could carry from my daughter's room and current belongings.  Baby items are not cheap.  Thought was then given to antique furniture like storage trunks and toy boxes around the house.  At this point, my mind starts to play the puzzle game of "How to fit all of this into the small space of our cars?"

My mind began to drift into my own list of items that I would pack in an effort to abandon the soon to be hurrican-stricken house.  The items that came to my mind were all based on their current importance in my life and the estimated cost to replace them.   The first items that came to my mind were the televisions and projector.  LCD screens and projector bulbs "ain't cheap neither".  Then I'd definitely pack up the Mac.  Those are incredibly expensive.  I'd pack up all of my music equipment. Although they are small pieces of analog electronics and circuitry,  they cost a great deal.  I would definitely bring every single tool that I own.  I thought to myself, if there's major damage to the house, better to have the tools on hand to fix it rather than to have to dig through the rubble in an attempt to find them.  After utilities, my mind drifted to clothing.  I'm definitely not addicted to clothes or shoes by any means.  I have a particular style, but it includes clothes that I've owned since high school.  Most of the items I would bring are just so I could have a clean pair of socks, underwear and an undershirt.  

And then it happened.  I found something that I'm emotionally attached to.  Until I met my wife, I'd never really been a fan of t-shirts.  I would always wear a polo or a button down shirt.  Then, my wife started purchasing t-shirts for me, or I would pick one up along the way.  Since then, whenever I would try to put on a polo, she'd get angry with me for dressing nicer than she did, and demand that I put on a t-shirt.  So i would.  Gradually,  I turned into a t-shirt in my down time person.  I now have a collection of t-shirts that I've gathered over time and to me they represent more than just a body covering or a fashion statement.  Each one represents a specific time or place in my past, and almost all of them are associated with good memories.  It's strange that I have an emotional attachment to clothing, but it's true.

I remember being that way about hats in my teenage years, but that's been a while (5 years).  
Anyways,  there's my emotional bit.  Now on to the update.

Yesterday was a lazy day.  I stayed up super late again, suprise!  Insomnia is going to catch up to me one of these days.  My daughter has been a ball of fun.  More of the same...

Eat, poop, eat while pooping, poop while eating, sleep, cry, suck on daddy's finger, and fall back asleep.  It's a vicious cycle.  

The best part of yesterday night though was the title picture for this post.  My daughter was full, awake, bright-eyed, and quiet. She was just listening to daddy talk.  Mommy was bored to death, but my daughter stared up into my eyes and listened intently like I was revealing the secrets to life and she needed to pay attention or write them down.  

It's definitely moments like those that make this crazy sleep schedule and intense chores around the house worth it.  I'm sure there will be more, but that's all I got for now.

Today was rainy.  We tried walking yesterday but got caught in it as the rain kept coming down.  Today was completely rainy without stopping.  We woke up at 10:45 when we had to be at the car dealership by 11 to get the oil changed and tires rotated on my truck.  We got breakfast at 11:30 and chilled at the house for the rest of the day.  Her parents came over tonight and hung out since school down here got cancelled for tomorrow.  It's causing the district down here some grief and chaos as tomorrow was the last day of school for the year and it's causing the local high school graduation to be indoors which hasnt happened in 21 years.  

Aside from that, I tried to get work done only to find out that I couldnt do too much because my work computer got moved/turned off.  Disconnected is a good thing I guess.  

Got another 4 ozs from pumping, which is a good thing.  Storing up supply so Daddy can take daughter places if mommy can't make it.

That's pretty much it.  4:04am and I'm signing off late again.  At least it's earlier than last night

God, I dont know if i've already missed any of the crazy awesome moments like the one pictured above, but I pray you slow me down enough that I don't miss any more.  I ask that you look out for me and continue to make me the christian role model fit to raise this amazing daughter you've blessed me with.  Thanks for making this part of life packed with excitement and memories.  Thanks for giving me the ability to reflect on it all.

Amen
