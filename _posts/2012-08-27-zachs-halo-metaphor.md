Another entry from the Old Facebook Notes section.&nbsp; This one is partly from one of the best roomates I ever had in college.&nbsp; He and I were both nerds who liked to play the Halo series and somehow we compared that to life. Here's what we came up with.

So Zach and I were sitting up talking the other night for a little while, mainly talking about the female gender, and all of a sudden out of the mouth of Zachary Wilson Simmons comes one of the best metaphors about girls that i have heard. This would be my attempt to recreate that to the best of my ability. Some of my own comparisons may be added in to this extended metaphor so i would like to apologize to Zach beforehand for probably not getting it right. But here it goes:


You know, girls are a lot like the weapons in the game Halo 2 in multiplayer.

When it comes to the weapons, you have the alien weapons, which are alien to say the least, and each one has their pros but theres just something about them that you end up not liking. Like the plasma rifle that just heats up and stops and becomes usesless for a while. Definitely not worth your time. The green plasma pistol is good for about 1 big shot, but after that one single blast, its weird, awkward and takes up at least a hand that could be used for other weapons. The alien battle rifle is decent, it just doesnt have the ammo to really last you. You have to be sure of what you are doing with it, or you can really screw yourself over. The brute shot is so weird, you cant really do much with it. You are never able to tell where the shots are gonna go, and if you dont know what you are doing, a brute shot could probably kill you the fastest. The alien sniper rifle is great and all when it comes to long range, its just that if you go too fast, it overheats and by the time it cools off, the real battle has become short range and the gun your using is again useless.

The human set is the most like the girls that you would actually want to go after.

Now for the part of the metaphor thats actually good, that Zach made ( with my elaborations, sorry).

You absolutely can't go with a pistol. It's a sidearm, a secondary weapon, and the only thing that happens is you use it until you can get to a better weapon and then you drop it like its hot. Its pretty much worth your while to completely forget about the pistol in the first place and to search for a much better weapon.

You may be walking along one day and find a shotgun. This is the shortrange dream weapon. Wipes anything out in your path. Its so good with the whole shortrange, but if you mention long range, this gun is rendered useless and you get wiped out. So you put it down. You keep goin and come along a sniper rifle. This weapon has long range in mind, and is extremely precise and takes a very skilled handler to be used effectively. Then one day, the battle is right up in your face, you and that weapon are pretty much toast. So you know its almost inevitable that you will lose that weapon at some point. So you keep going and you come across a rocket launcher. This seems to be the perfect weapon, you can sometimes go long range, you can definitely own short range, and you can tackle big obstacles like banshees or warthogs. The only problem is that you have about 2 shots. So if you screw up or miss at all, either you are left with a completely useless weapon, or You are left compelely useless. So after all this time of running along looking for the right weapon, you finally come across this stupid looking battle rifle. You knew where it was all along, you just thought that you could do better. So you pick it up finally and give it a try, and regaurdless of how lame you think it might be, it gets the job done. Suprisingly, this weapon can do it all, short range, long range, medium range. At first you thought this weapon was stupid and useless, but now you know that this was the only weapon you needed all along and for some reason, it just feels like it fits, something about it feels right.

Thanks goes to Zach Simmons for coming up with the idea.

Again i apologize for so much elaboration.
