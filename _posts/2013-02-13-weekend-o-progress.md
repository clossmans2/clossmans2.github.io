What an awesome weekend! So much accomplished.  Way to much to talk about.  How about some pics to illustrate.

My parents came down from Elloree to work on Charlotte's Room.  It looked rough beforehand.

My parents brought my guns down for me and I realized what I thought was an old cowboy gun that my parents brought me was an old Steyr Model 1905 from Argentina.  Only 10,000 were made. Awesome.

Yesterday, my Dad and I were able to finish most of the painting in Charlotte's bedroom.  It looks incredible.  From where it was to where it is, some amazing things have been done. Some serious progress was made.  We weren't 100% complete when they left, but we're pretty darn close.

Sunday morning my parents got to see wifey and I perform at church.  Didn't necessarily have the best morning, but I love hanging out with them.

Next to last, we brought new friends into our home for our Super Bowl party and they said they're coming back to small group tomorrow.  Good times!

Lastly, the best part of the weekend by far happened around the middle of the third quarter of the Super Bowl.  The wife asked me to come upstairs with her for a quick second.  When I came in to the bedroom, she was sitting on the floor with her legs crossed and had both hands placed softly against her midsection where my future daughter Charlotte is.  She said "Come see if you can feel her".  Now I'd seen her on the ultrasound and thought that was a pretty cool technology to be able to see the face of your baby before she's born.  I was not expecting much in this situation.  Besides, Id been using my hands all weekend to help paint, cook and play guitar.  I thought they would be way too desensitized to feel anything at all.  I had no idea.

I had just finished pulling apart the Boston butt that we cooked all day so my hands were covered in pig fat and grease.  Immediately I ran to the sink in the master bathroom to wash my hands.  After finishing I walked back out and knelt beside my seated wife.  She took my hands and placed them on her right hand side.  Twice she asked me "Did you feel that?"  I honestly couldn't feel anything.  I was disconnected at that moment and again didn't expect to feel anything at all.  She continued moving my hands around on the right side of her tummy.  After a minute or two, my legs were starting to ache from the way I was squatting down beside her.  I was about ready to give up and just say "It's ok, we'll try again tomorrow."  All of a sudden I felt something.  To describe the sensation, i'll use a comparison.  I have an iPhone 5 with a gigantic otter box case that covers it.  When I'm bored and not playing on my iPhone, I'll occasionally tap the corner of it in the palm of my hand.  It felt like 2 taps of my iPhone Otterbox case in 2 different spots, but this time coming from underneath the surface of the skin on my wife's pregnant belly.  I experienced a small connection that even not at 4:00 AM when I'm writing this has stuck with me.  

It was as if at that moment, I felt a connection to the child that will be here in a few months.  I didn't know what to say.  I just sat there, speechless.  Gabi looked up at me and asked me what I was thinking.  I had no idea how to put it into words (obviously it's taken me till now to actually get all this down in word form) what I felt at that moment.  It finally clicked that "I'm a father, and I played a role in creating that life."  I guess my biggest fear at this point is that I wont be a good enough father.  I fear that I won't be able to maintain the right balance.  Maybe I'll spend my days working too late and miss out on my daughter growing up because I am working my rear end off to make a better life for her.  Maybe I'll spend too much time with her and not be able to provide the life for her that she deserves.  Maybe I'll focus too much on those priorities and lose sight of my personal goals with Grad School making me fail to follow my own dreams to enter a career that I am actually passionate about.  Talk about a terrible role model for my daughter at that point. 

I know that I am excited and nervous, panicked and calm, protective and open, elated and fearful.  I have a battle raging inside me.  I always worry about whether I'll be good enough for her.  I know that God's got my back, and that if I follow his instructions he'll help me out.  I know that the fact that I am worried about that makes me a better father than those who leave their unborn children never to return.  I know that although I may not get it right every time that if she's anything like me, she'll forgive me and tell me that I'm an amazing father for all the things I have done.

I am reminded of my namesake.  Two brothers (sons of Adam) born into different professions.  The one who got it right was murdered.  The other was banished.  When everything fell apart and the first human parents had lost two boys at that point, God sent Seth.  Sure he was the backup.  Not exactly first string, but he was the God's version of a replacement.  He wasn't Abel, but he was able.  He basically kept the world turning and continued their line.  There wasn't much more mentioned of Seth, but we know that he was handed a pretty large responsibility from a very early age.  I like to think of him as the replacement that nobody expected, but everybody approved of in the end because he got the job done.  He played his role.  Secondly, I'm reminded of Daniel.  He refused to bow down to somebody else's idol and got thrown to the lions.  He felt so strongly about his beliefs that he was willing to give up his life for it.  God saved him and his buddies "Shad, Me, and Abed".  He stood firm and it paid off.

If you've held on for this long, here's the part where I circle the story back around and make the connection to my original story.  I think I'll be ok though.  If I hold on to my beliefs and stand firm in my convictions (Daniel), although I won't be the best Dad ever, God will turn me into the father that my daughter needs and the husband that my wife needs (Seth).
