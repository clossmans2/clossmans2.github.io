Sunday morning, we were going to make my daughter's first trip to Church.  We got up in time, left a little late, and arrived shortly after the music had started.  The worship leader picked on us shortly after arriving saying that half of the congregation got up and crowded us when we came in because everybody wanted to see the baby.  The baby managed to stay asleep throughout the entire service.  I knew I had an amazing daughter.

She was even bobbing her head to the music.  Good girl!  Not too long after church, may parents took off back home.  They had a "technical" family member's birthday party to get to.  We then got to spend time with my wife's college roommate who was stopping by to see her new "niece".  They didn't get to stay long but it's always good to see long time friends.  After that, I was to the point of crashing and finally got the opportunity to.  After watching over "my girl" while she and my wife slept, I had racked up a pretty large amount of tired.  I crashed somewhere around 12:15am on Monday morning and did not end up waking up until 1:30pm Monday afternoon.  I got plenty of rest, I just felt out of it.  All in all, great weekend, great family, all good fun.  My daughter didn't have a hard time with any of it.  Now if we could just keep this go with the flow attitude for a lot longer, that would be great.

God,  You've given me an excellent life, an amazing family, and the most gorgeous child I could ask for.  I occasionally have to pinch myself to remind myself that this is reality and not some dream.  I pray that you'll continue to make me a father after your own heart and that you'll help me to grow closer to my daughter over time.  You're the role model that I look to.  You've done this only a few trillion times.  You've got the experience.  And you also have the instruction manual.  Teach me to trust those around me with experience and knowledge as I travel into this new adventure of fatherhood.

Amen!
