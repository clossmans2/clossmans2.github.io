## Far Sighted: Prayer

Yeah, So it's 1:22 AM as I start writing this and it kind of re-enforces the point I'll be trying to make.  On Sunday morning, one of my best friends gave a sermon at church on the vision of our church.  Specifically, he talked about prayer.  Before I get started on what he talked about, let me talk for a second on how I feel and think about prayer.

Prayer (noun): 
  A solemn request for help or expression of thanks addressed to God or an object of worship.

I've always seen prayer as a way to talk to God.  It's our method of communicating with our creator.  It seems like a super powerful tool.  Here's the tough part though.  I'm still not completely clear on whether I believe in pre-destination or arminianism (the ability to choose whether or not I will allow Jesus to save me <- super short and probably incorrect description).  I do believe that I server a God who was a purpose for everything.  I also believe that God knew me before I was born and knows how my life will end already.  I believe he exists outside of the human construct of time.  

One of my biggest hang-ups has always been that if God already knows whats going to happen in every moment of my life and can already see what I believe to be my decision and the way I will *choose* to go, what is the point of prayer. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing.  I'm mainly just saying that if the outcome has already been decided in every situation I will face, what is the purpose of asking God to intervene or alter it.  I know he'll intervene when he sees fit, and that he's got a reason to put me through tough times (Jeremiah 29:11-13).  When I get beat down by the troubles life puts me through, I know that as sick and twisted as I think that it is that God would allow me to go through a situation like the ones I'll face that he's got a reason for it and I'll have to ask him about it when I go to be with him one day.  So if I trust that he's got everything under control and rely on him, what's the point of praying.

Let's be honest here.  Even when Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane(sp?) and asked if there was any way possible for God to let this cup pass him, to let that happen.  Jesus still went to the cross.  That's a pretty rough way to go, but God had a reason for it.  If he hadn't prayed, it still would have ended the same way.  When Jesus gave the *example* prayer, and let me say that again, he gave the *example* of how to pray in what we refer to as **The Lord's Prayer**, he basically went through the general list of things to pray about.  To start with, he asked that God would make sure that they got their basic needs met.  He then continued by asking for God to help people forgive us for times when we did wrong to them, and then asked God for help to forgive people who wronged us.  He asked God to keep us on the *straight and narrow* by not leading us into temptation and keep us safe from the truly bad things out there in the world.  He finishes up by proclaiming the awesome nature of God and his authority over us now and for the rest of eternity.  Again, his example was not really asking for anything to gigantic.  At the same time, he was praying for things that God doesn't necessarily have to do for us.

I used to say that prayer just wasn't one of my spiritual gifts.  I just liked working in the background and being God's logistical problem solver.  I'm a big advocate of applying the scientific method to innovate.  I like science.  Prayer has always seemed like a touchy-feely thing to me. I have prayed intensely before, but I've never seen any miraculous cures or *too-strange-to-be-coincidence* situations following that prayer.  I've also had a really hard time believing that prayer has healed anyone around me.  Working in a medical technology field and working with cancer treatment algorigthms has taught me a lot about expected outcomes in treatment.  Having a mom that works as a lab tech in a cancer treatment center has also given me a strange perspective on it all.  I have no idea how she's able to deal with the pain of losing people that she builds relationships with at that job.  At the same time, I can't say I've ever seen a situation that couldn't be explained away by sound medical expertise.  So needless to say, I was a bit skeptical coming in to Sunday morning.  I gave my best friend the benefit of the doubt and decided to hear what he had prepared.

Unfortunately, I had to work the sound board and play in the band that morining so I ended up losing most of the notes I had on the sermon.  I do remember the one thing though that he said to take away from the talk if nothing else.  He said "Prayer provides focus".  I have a decent memory, so I also took away that he said "Prayer provides focus for your heart, vision, and action, and that as we pray our heart opens up, our vision becomes clear and the action becomes obvious".  I believe that was the entire gist of his sermon.

The word focus carries some weight for me.  I was diagnosed about 2 years ago with Adult ADHD (Inattentive type).  Focus is one thing I tend to lack without my medication.  Even when I'm on my medication, staying focused on the right things is still a major undertaking.  The fact that it's 2 A.M. and I'm still writing this should illustrate that point.

Here's my daily schedule to give you even more perspective.

- 8:30 AM: Subconsciously wake up and turn off my alarm clock.
- 8:45 AM: Roll over, see the clock and jump out of bed knowing that I'm going to arrive late to work.
- 9:15 AM: Sprint through the door to my office and rush to my desk
- 2:20 PM: Realize that I've barely stopped to breathe and force myself to take a break to eat something.
- 6:30 PM: Answer the phone as my wife calls to ask if I'm planning to come home tonight.
- 7:00 PM: Arrive at home 15 minutes later than I told my wife I'd be. Begin cooking supper.
- 9:00 PM: Finish serving my family and wolf down what I have left.
- 9:04 PM: Look after and entertain my 2 year old and 2 month old while my wife catches up on everything she couldn't get to with a crying child and amazing but sometimes jealous toddler.
- 12:05 AM: Give my 2 year old a bath and lay down with her until she falls asleep in her bed.
- 12:10 AM: Pass out in my 2 year old's bed from exhaustion.
- Repeat Daily

I definitely don't stop.  It's only at times like this where I eat away at potential sleep time when I can sit down and collect my thoughts.  Life is insane.  Focus time is at a premium.  It's times like this where I realize I need to prayer.  When I try to squeeze out the last few kilowatts of brain power to make a decision regarding family finances or some event that is coming up soon, I need prayer.  Prayer is not supposed to be your time to run through your wishlist for God.  It's a perfectly acceptible time to do that, but that shouldn't be the main reason you pray.  Life has an uncanny ability to cloud our judgement.  It makes decision making take a lot more energy and effort than it should.  God gave us prayer as a way to stop and reflect.  He gave it to us as a way to see him in the things we do each day.  He expects us to use it guide our actions.  Without it, we fly blind.  With it, the skies are clear.  It's the random person that turns on their phone lamp while you are trying to read a map in the dark.  It's meant to make the Eureka moments happen more often.  God doesn't want you trying to lead other people to him when you can't see out the windshield of your vehicle.  It's one thing that we don't make enough time for and most of the time we go into it with an agenda.  God speaks to us in the silence.  When life is blaring at 1000 decibels, it's pretty tough to hear his voice.  Our vision clears when we slow down enough to see out through the rain.  When our vision finally starts to clear up, the path forward becomes obvious.  

I pray that God will help me to make the time to sit in the quiet and sharpen my focus.  I pray that my vision will finally start to clear up and that the choices I'll have to make will become obvious.
