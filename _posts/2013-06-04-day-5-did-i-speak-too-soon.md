<!--more-->

It started off as a really good day.  We had plenty of time to hang out, we finally got some sleep, and life in general was beginning to look up.  That's when stuff got difficult.  After watching the Carolina baseball game and preparing to head to bed at 11:45pm, my daughter started getting a bit "fussy" if you will.  By fussy, I mean she didn't really want to stop eating.  She would feed for a few minutes, then settle down for 30 seconds, then feel like she was hungry again and cry out to be fed.

Are you serious?  Didnt we just go through this 2 nights ago?  Yep.  We did.  And it was happening again.  She just couldnt get full.  At about 4am, I passed out in bed.  I couldnt handle anymore.  My wife being the trooper she is managed to get back up after 4am and continue feeding her.  I woke up at 7 that morning on the floor of the nursery when my daughter had finally gotten her fill and wanted to lay down to sleep.  

Yep.  7am.  She partied so hard all night long that she finally crashed at 7am.  I started getting a little worried.  I knew it was normal for babies to want to coninuously feed, but we're talking about day 5 here.  Her OB said that the milk should come in within 48 hours.  I was worried we had a little piglet on our hands or that she had a tape worm.

Thanks to the marvelous invention of the internet, I looked up feeding habits and milk production after a Caesarean section on Google and managed to find some information stating that milk typically didnt begin to show up until 5-7 days after a C-section birth compared to those studied in the other group with normal vaginal birth.  That meant that we still had another day of a colostrum feeding frenzy.  Lovely.  

I managed to pull it all together and salvage the day thanks to my mother in law who happened to have spent the night that evening.  I completely forget what day it is anymore, but thankfully, it was sunday meaning that she was going to be off work.  

She took the baby at 7 and let my wife and I get some sleep.

At around 4pm, I got up for a grocery store run.  Wow.  Life feels weird when your head isnt clear from the lack of sleep.  I grabbed a few necessities and some frozen meals to hold us over on these kinds of days.  Then went to Starbucks for my wife and mother in law as a thank you for being awesome and watching after my daughter while my weakling self passes out at 4am.  Then off to Dominos to pick up dinner before heading back home.  The trip outside of the house was somewhat refreshing, but I still felt a heavy weight of exhaustion.

God has been giving me some remarkable energy spurts, but there are still days where I feel like the token dim-witted guy from movies that is pretty much standing in the corner that then gets asked to go get some hot water so these people can deliver their baby.  What do they actually need hot water for anyways?  No idea on that one.  Anyways, I am very thankful for healthy baby, a supportive family, and a wife who was built tough enough to handle this child rearing thing right along side me.  Its not been an easy journey in the past 4 days, but it's been an exciting and incredibly fulfilling one.  I pray that God will continue to teach me how to be a dad to this extraordinary little girl.

Amen!
