The final installment of the Old Facebook Notes series.  This, as described below, is about a song I wrote in high school for my 2 member acoustic band that was formed to impress girls.  It was pretty good...

So a long while ago (high school/who knows where all this random HS stuff is coming from) i thought i could be a songwriter. I guess at that point i was just trying to impress girls. Some have probably even heard one of my first songs entitled "girl of my dreams" if you have been around me while playing guitar. Nonetheless, i started wanting to write something deeper. I wanted to write about something i was passionate about. This is by no means professional songwriting ability, but i will say i did a very good job. This was my only song to ever truly get published. Yes, thats right. Published. And not published like in a school newspaper or something. This thing got put in some book full of other kids poems that is now being kept in the library of congress or something like that. Anyways, comment and let me know what you think.


Unsatisfied

Verse 1

While in the dark why are we always wanting light

Why do we seek the shadows when everything's so bright

Why cant we be satisfied with what He gives

Is it just society or is it the way we live


Verse 2

We get what we want and we devour what we take

But inside we all agree that the feeling is a fake

Reaching for that star thats just too high

Your life becomes a problem you wonder how you can get by


Chorus

Material things take up the brighter part of the day

Constantly workin for money never tryin to be in the way

If he came back now would you be left behind

With that sad sad day replaying in your mind


Verse 3

Do you just go daily and look up to the sky

You ask the Lord the eternal question why

Why am I here and what do I want to do

I bet you never ask the Lord what can I do for You

Chorus 2x

Bridge

Maybe if we tried to analyze our time

The world is gettin a dollar and He is gettin a dime

Chorus

Last 2 Lines of Chorus

Fade Out

Again, not the best, but pretty dagum good for high school, let me know what you think.
