The night closed with another first, and by far one of the scariest/most nerve wracking experiences in my own life...

<!--more-->

We let her sleep by herself in her crib down the hall, alone, without anyone in the room, as a newborn, completely void of people being around...no protection other than a blanket, and no reassurance other than a baby monitor.

This would be the part that I didnt pick up from any of the blogs or new parent books that I read on the way to becoming a dad.  None of them talked about the sheer terror you experience as a parent when you are separated from your helpless newborn by several walls and at least 20 feet with the only connection being a realtime audio feed from her room.  

The one thing that the blogs and articles I read did talk about that caused me to panic so much was Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).  I read about it in many different articles.  Although the occurence is pretty rare, I sat almost all night listening to that baby monitor.  I couldnt figure out why I was so scared.  I knew she would wake up and cry when she got hungry.  I knew that we had the baby monitor turned up so loud that a cry would probably be as loud as a jet engine through it.  I just couldnt find the inner confidence to believe that I would wake up from crying and in turn my wife wouldnt wake up either because she's still in recovery stages from surgery.  

At 4am (the Seth goes down hour) I crashed.  I got back up at 11am and the world was alright and my daughter had done just fine on her own.

Let me skip ahead to where stuff actually happens.  The part I'm skipping really only includes me waking up, having an upset stomach, getting ready and hopping in the car for the first time with the baby since we left the hospital.

We made it to the Pediatrician's office without a problem.  The office staff was mid gossip session as expected.  My wife and I were taken back to the 1990's when we had to fill out all of the paperwork for a new patient on pieces of paper on a clipboard instead of filling the forms out online.  We got taken back and encountered at least one nurse that was not having a great day.  No idea why, but she was just in somewhat of a foul mood.

We managed to make it through and find out that Charlotte is actually a very healthy baby. She now weighed 8lbs exactly.  Hearing the pediatrician say that they can lose up to 10% of their body weight when they first start breast feeding and that my daughter had not come close to that told me that the feeding was working.  The doctor even pointed out that she had feeding blisters on her lips indicating that she was feeding very well.  She stretched out a half inch from the hospital and now came in at a respectable 20 inches long.  Her head had also increased in size about an inch from 13 to 14 (definitely my genes).  

She had a clean bill of health and life was good.  After the appointment, we took the time to stop by and see my mother in law to thank her for staying with us the other night.  She was finishing up some work at a nearby middle school and heading back to her own.  We went from there to my father in law's school, which was right down the street, so that my wife could feed again before making the long treck back home.  We finished up with everything and then decided to stop for some coffee.  I definitely didnt expect to be hanging outside this much, but I was definitely enjoying it.  Hopefully things will continue progressing this quickly and I'll be taking her to meet the rest of my family sometime soon.

We made it back home safely after dark and managed to have a pretty smooth night.  Things were finally going our way.  My daughter fed right on schedule, I still stayed up to 5:30AM listening to the baby monitor, and my wife was able to get some sleep.  I could probably sleep, but I still worry some.

I pray that God would give me peace about it as he also reaches out to keep my daughter safe in the other room.  I would like to get some sleep and I believe he's really the only one that can make that happen for me at this point.  I pray that the cute little sounds I hear will quiet down and that I'll learn to trust that everything is ok and that my daddy instincts will wake me up if I need it.  Thanks for helping me through the troubled times God and please help me to get some sleep.

Amen!
