Saturday was an excellent day overall.  My parents made it into town.  <!--more-->My Grandparents happened to make their way into town as well.  You've gotta love the differences between experiences parents with older kids and new parents.  First, My wife and I hadn't gotten out of bed yet when they pulled into my driveway.  That was a crazy start for us, but we managed to have a good time.  After the pictures and general hang out time, I got to sit and watch college baseball with my grandparents on the big screen.  They are excellent "come and hang out partners."

My grandparents headed back home after a while.  My brother, dad and I ended up going down to one of the public docks on the may river.  Always a fun time.  We put our feet in the water off the edge of the dock and just watched the boats go by.  It was an all around good day.

On another note,  I got to introduce my family to the "Bluth" family... I showed them Arrested Development.  They like it, and will probably go home and continue watching it.  I still didnt get any sleep, but I did get some awesome pictures of Charlotte getting to hang with my family and of the 4 generations of my family under one roof.  I love them and I always enjoy when they get to visit. Another short post because I've got to get some sleep.
