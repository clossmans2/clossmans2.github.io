<div>They say there is a first time for everything. The only thing is, this particular post i wouldnt consider my first time. The last time I tried to start a blog i ended up having to shut it down thanks to some psychotic people (whose names were never mentioned) that I thought I was friends with.</div><div> </div><div>Now that I have graduated from college and am making an attempt to enter into the world of marketing I figured blogging itself should have another chance. I feel like I have already been around the block to every other form of social media and now am coming back to my first love. I just dont know if the feeling is still there.</div><p> </p><div>Well enough about that. Here's a little about me to go along with the first post. I graduated in May 2009 from Winthrop University with a B.S. (properly named) degree in Integrated Marketing Communication. Don't get me wrong, I loved <a title="Winthrop" href="http://www.winthrop.edu/">Winthrop</a> and I do believe that I am more finely tuned than most people graduating with a general Business Marketing degree, but there's a lot of stuff a liberal arts degree crams in that nobody else has to go through.</div><p> </p><div> </div><p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ah0awJblbxY/S3xydxgRtVI/AAAAAAAAAAM/50PcLvo7wWg/s320/Tillman_tower.jpg" alt="" border="0" />I have to stop with these tangents. Where was I? Oh yeah! After graduating I started working at an international electronic parts distributor out of Charlotte, NC. That lasted about a month before the European Economy followed suite with the rest of the world and due to the lack of work, I was let go. I searched around for about a week and then found a position called "Internet Sales" at a car dealership. I thought to myself "How hard can that be?" I had no idea what I had gotten myself into.<img src="http://sethclossman.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/base_media.jpg?w=300" alt="" border="0" /></p><p> </p><div> </div><div>Starting off with a salary of $300 per week, I was asked to build the internet department from the ground up. I started slow and gradually built my business. The Cash for Clunkers scramble actually hurt my business because people had to come into the dealership first to determine eligibility for their clunker. The month following, when demand for new cars was at an all time low, I became salesman of the month due to my high number of sales over the internet. I had earned my manufacturer's certification and became the "Internet Sales Manager." I did well enough that month to pay for an engagement ring for my fiancee. A week later I proposed to her and now am on the fast track to being married in July.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div>So after the Salesman of the Month ordeal, the owners son (read Used Car Manager) walks into my office and begins talking to me about the dealership's advertising and marketing. I listen in because this is one thing that I have wanted to get my hands in since graduation. He says "What would you think if we handed you over the advertising duties, found a salary for you out of the ad expenditures, and you would never sell cars anymore after that?" Of course my answer was YES!</div><div> </div><p> </p><div>The following month (October), I truly started the position. The owner had given me the task of writing my own job description but I was up for the challenge. I worked hard in that position contrary to what people thought. I brought a $30k ad spending habit (see also advertising budget of $15k) from the red back into the black. I even made enough room for me to double my current salary of less than minimum wage. I cancelled contracts that had been signed in the dealership and sucking life from it all the way back when dinosaurs roamed Rock Thrill. I started a killer social media campaign that was actually begining to take shape. I even used the rest of the money to get some local market share back from the other two foreign dealerships near them. Who else was in charge of the website and all the inventory online other than me? Nobody! Had any true marketing firm or advertising agency taken notice, I probably would have been getting job offers. But they didn't. (To tell you the truth, I really liked most of the people I worked with, even my managers. It was really the top level management and poor decision making ability on their part that made life difficult.)</div><div>And I definitely wasn't getting paid anywhere near an ad agency either. At the end of the month, i discovered nothing had happened to my pay. I was still making well below minimum wage (car salesman's salary) and working in an upper level management position. I decided to ask someone about it and thought "who better than my friendly boss?" I asked "Hey, I was wondering whether it is illegal to be paid less than minimum wage?" I recall him saying, "Not exactly, it depends." He came to talk with me about it and when he realized that I really wasn't selling cars anymore with all the ad responsibilities, he went to go talk to the owner about it. I felt proud of myself. I finally stood up to my superiors and asked for the pay I deserved for doing the work I did.</div><div> </div><p> </p><div>About two hours later, my boss comes downstairs, walks into my office, and shuts the door behind him. He then looked me straight in the eyes with a worried/sad look on his face. He opens his mouth and a cliche phase I had heard before comes out of his mouth. "I have some good news and some bad news." Wanting to finish the conversation on a good note, I chose to hear the bad news first. "Mr. Burns decided that he wants to phase out the position, and wanted me to let you go along with it". I said "I can't even have a sales position back?" "I said that too, and they seem to think that you weren't that great of a salesman." "I was salesman of the month, how the heck could they think this?" I thought. "The good news is that we finalized your job description, too bad we wont need it now." It was about 5pm at that point and he told me I could get my stuff together then and leave. I looked at him and thought "So gracious, letting me have the rest of the day off when I won't have a job tomorrow." I pulled out that day angry.</div><div> </div><p> </p><div>After about a month of working manual labor for my uncle in Sumter, I was able to get a job at a mid-sized company in Columbia selling pharmaceutical products. Not the career goal I graduated with, but definitely better than selling cars or being unemployed. The economy is so bad right now that the young kids with the brightest minds that are most up to date with how technology works and trends in society are the ones having the hardest time finding jobs. It may have been hard coming out of high school during a war and being drafted or coming out before the information super highway known as the internet was invented, but all of those people had less going against living successful lives than we do now. We have left the safe harbor of college for a passage straight out into the deep storm plagued ocean of the real world. Here's the catch 22 that sets us up to fail.</div><div> </div><p> </p><ol><ol><li>There are only a limited number of jobs available.</li></ol></ol><p><br /><br /></p><ol><ol><li>Employers in specialized fields in which most people graduate want at least 2 years of experience for a position we trained 4 years in school and spent over $30,000+ for.</li></ol></ol><p><br /><br /></p><ol><ol><li>Employers in stable but retail/food and beverage businesses dont want to hire us for even positions paying minimum wage because they believe that a bachelor's degree means they have to pay us more.</li></ol></ol><p><br /><br /></p><ol><li>With the state of the economy and financial market, the companies that gave us our student loans that we used to get a degree that we thought would get us better jobs are now less lenient on repayment. We are now basically set up to ruin our credit report, live off welfare, and die pretty quickly because none of us can afford insurance without a job.</li></ol><p>It's tough world, but I guess somebody had to take the brunt of it. I just wish it didn't have to be my generation...</p>
