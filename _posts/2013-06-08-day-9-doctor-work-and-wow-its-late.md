So today was not really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.  That's why Ive decided to make this more of a look at pictures post than a speak my mind post.  We basically went to the OB, took my daughter into my office to meet my coworkers, then came back home and chilled.  It was fun, but somewhat uneventful.  Lots of napping on my wifes part.  Lots of chilling out on mine.  I ended up getting my test web server up and running.  Thats about it.

I did end up getting to see all of these awesome faces my daughter was making at the OB office on camera though.  The only one that I missed that would have been worth all these grumpy looking faces was her "Fonzi" impression.  With her eyes almost all the way closed, she lifted her right hand and gave a thumbs up tilted her head slightly and gave a half smile, all at the same time.  IT WAS ADORABLY AWESOME!!!  I wish I was quick enough to have been able to capture it to share it with the world. 

Short post tonight but i think I deserve it after 10 solid days of blogging.  Enjoy the pics. Ill be back tomorrow.
