				<p>Sunday morning, we were going to make my daughter’s first trip to Church.  We got up in time, left a little late, and arrived shortly after the music had started.  The worship leader picked on us shortly after arriving saying that half of the congregation got up and crowded us when we came in because everybody wanted to see the baby.  The baby managed to stay asleep throughout the entire service.  I knew I had an amazing daughter.

So today was not really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.  That’s why Ive decided to make this more of a look at pictures post than a speak my mind post.  We basically went to the OB, took my daughter into my office to meet my coworkers, then came back home and chilled.  It was fun, but somewhat uneventful.  Lots of napping on my wifes part.  Lots of chilling out on mine.  I ended up getting my test web server up and running.  Thats about it.

				<p>My wife and I were talking in the car the other day about a tropical storm that is getting close to hitting us now and what growing up in this area was like compared to the area where I grew up.  She mentioned that preparing for a hurricane was a difficult process, but that it made her care more about relationships than possessions.  She said that they knew they could only take what would fit in their car.  That meant that a family of 4 could only take the things that mattered most to them.

				<p>Looking at the previous 7 days. i’ve actually been 1 day ahead because of my day 0/1.  Technically when I am writing this, I am well into day 8 and i’ve been slack on keeping up with this.  I’m actually going to be covering day 6 and day 7.

				<p>So yesterday was more of a recovery day than anything else.  The night closed with another first, and by far one of the scariest/most nerve wracking experiences in my own life…

				<p>Day 4 started out the way I had imagined my baby PTO time would.  Sleep in, serve my wife and daughter, run the house, and just enjoy being a family.  I got to start playing the new father role for real.  I was able to hold my daughter again on my chest while she was sleeping for another 2 or 3 hours.  I slept in late, and got to really enjoy my time with her.  The only scary part was that when I woke up, she was in the crook of my right arm.  She’s a wiggler.  I keep calling her daddy’s little wiggle worm.  The problem is, I sleep almost at the edge of the right side of the bed.  Had she gone any further without me waking up, she could have rolled off of my bed.  Not what I had planned for day 4.  Thankfully she did not.  My wife woke me up and put her back on to my chest.  I managed to put a blanket over her on top of me to help prevent her from wiggling that far.  Even still she managed to wiggle the top of her body all the way from next to my neck down to the crook of my left arm.  She’s a mover.

				<p>Let me start off by saying that I am still 1 day behind at this point because of the events that took place on the first real night.  The cluster feeding thing kept me up so long that I never had time to actually sit down and write anything at all.  I am one for late nights, but that was crazy.  To have to go all night, sleep for only about 2 hours, get up and play good host followed by staying up till 5am the next day… I have finally met my match.

				<p>a little on the unexpected side of things, night number 2 was definitely rougher than night one.My daughter began  her cluster feeding time period and things got crazy.  in short, it was so rough that i didnt have time to post until now.  For those uninitiated or unaware, cluster feeding is where the baby finally realizes what true hunger is and feeds almost continuously for long periods of time because it cant get satisfied on the collostrum that is being produced by the mother at that point.
