				<p>Another post from the Facebook collection.  This one focuses on some of the inner thoughts from the mind of a nice guy.  Check it out...
So when a nice guy takes a girl out that he is attracted to, these are some of the things running through his mind.




At the movies: "Dangit, she got in front of me and payed for her ticket, i hate that, she doesnt ever let me treat her like she needs to be treated. Oh well... I guess she is the only person that i would ever let make me go see a G rated movie... okay, so i know i have something for her and i think she knows, does that make it okay for me to hold her hand right now, i havent had anything to eat thats greasy and my hands arent too rough, should i do it, nah, ill be conservative, if i do it and she doesnt like it, it could cause problems in our friendship...Man that movie was really really kid-like, but i sure am glad she enjoyed it, it makes me happy that she is happy..."



At the restaurant: "Man i am hungry, but shoot, this is like the first or second time i have actually been out on a real date with her, i dont need to order anything big, plus im broke and i still want to pay for something of hers... This conversation is going really well, i wonder what she thinks about me, i am kind of afraid to say what i really feel because i think it could really jeopardize what i have been working towards for so long... Its crazy to think about, but i believe that i might actually could see myself doing this in about 3 or 4 more years but with her having a ring on her finger and us actually being together, heck, i think i really dont think i would mind spending the rest of my life with this girl, but i know shes not thinking that, shes got so much on her plate right now that theres no way she could think about settling down... I wish there was some way that i could get across to her what i want to say, but the dagum english language just makes it so hard... Gosh she really looks beautiful, its still hard for me to believe that she has problems with self esteem, she is so perfect, just the way the light makes her eyes sparkle, i wish i could stay right here with her forever... yes, i am going to pay for you, reguardless of how much you try to pay for yourself, i guess you can leave the tip, and yes i am broke, but let me do this one thing to show you how much i appreciate being able to spend time with you..."



Dropping her off at the end of the night: "Okay, this has been probably one of the most amazing nights i have had in a long time and we really didnt do anything spectacular, just getting to spend a little bit of time with her made all the difference... Umm, crap, i hate this part, this is the part that i fear like every time, this has been an awesome date but does she realize what i am feeling, does she feel the same, dangit, and i have to analyze this in only 15 seconds because its a short walk to her front door, dont they have computers or something that can do this, this is too much to think about, the big question, do i kiss her, and if yes do i kiss her on the cheek or on the lips, and if no, do i just give her a hug or is the vibe im feeling so bad that i should just shake her hand and tell her thanks and goodnight... It would be amazing to kiss her, but she seems tired, i think ill play conservative one more time and just give her a hug, man that stinks, but if i go for it all and she isnt feeling it, then it will ruin this awesome thing that we have, why do girls have to be so complicated, why does all this have to come down at one time... ok im at the door, i want to kiss her, shes stalling, im going in, no, she went to the hug position, i guess that was the right thing to do then, mabye one day it might happen, or mabye im not good enough for her, i have had a lot of mistakes in my life, mabye that scares her and i know she could do a whole lot better than me, but there is something there that keeps me hooked, that keeps me captivated... i hate getting back into my car and going home after such an awesome thing, at least it was a good time, hopefully next time will be better...
