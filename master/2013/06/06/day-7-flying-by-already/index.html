Technically when I am writing this, I am well into day 8 and i've been slack on keeping up with this.  I'm actually going to be covering day 6 and day 7. 

First, let me attempt to explain my experience over the last 7 days with some code...
<code>
## Fatherhood explained in python 2.7
import infant
import newParents
baby = infant.New() # a baby is born

dad =  newParents.uselessLogic() # in comes dad

mom = newParents.globalProcess() # mom aka giver/maintainer of all

event 
class Parenthood():

def firstWeekParenthood(self, mom, dad, baby):
	firstWeekParenthood.self = self.new
	event = baby.currentState
	time = dad.internalClock
	status = mom.currentProcess
	if event == crying:
		dad.investigateReason(crying):
			if crying == hungerSigns:
				return mom.feedingTime
			elif crying == baby.fullDiaper:
				dad.diaperChange
				return baby.toMomOrCrib
			else:
				dad.fourthTrimesterTeachings(baby):
				return baby.toMomOrCrib;
	else:
		dad.wonderWhatsHappening(baby)
		return dad.checkOnBaby;

import sleeping

sleep = sleeping.hoursPerNight()
dayEnd = sleeping.hourSleepBegins()

mom.sleep(8) #overall time, divided into 2 hour segments
baby.sleep(14) #including naps
dad.sleep(3) #baby monitor induced insomnia
dad.dayEnd(0500)

def conceptOfTime(dad)
	baby.ageInDays = 0
	for (hoursAccumulated == 24)
	baby.ageInDays = baby.ageInDays + 1
	while dad.ptoDay == True
		distort(reality)
		distort(time)

end()
	
</code>

So after that brief intermission...

Yesterdays run down in a nutshell

<ul>
	<li>I got to see my daughter smile for the first time.</li>
	<li>A friend from wife's grad school class brought us supper and brought her newborn son to meet my daughter (a little scary to think that boy's are already coming around).</li>
	<li>We finally got in my wife's breast pump so i cleaned it</li>
	<li>Watched a movie my mother gave us for christmas about soothing a baby using some standard methods</li></ul>

They talked about <ol>
	<li>Swaddling</li>
	<li>Side</li>
	<li>Shushing</li>
	<li>Swinging</li>
	<li>Sucking</li></ol>

We tried them.  They work excellently.  If it's true that babys have a calming reflex, it definitely makes them appear like they are suddenly on drugs after crying and completely stopping.

My wife fed my nerd side and got me a book that came in.  More on that story on fathers day.

I still havent been able to sleep.  I was up until 6am.

Yesteday (doensnt feel like it yet), got up at 1pm, a little late to do anything.  Helped my wife use the breast pump for the first time and she was actually able to fill a 4oz bottle and then continue feeding our daughter.  THE WOMAN IS A MACHINE, i tell ya.  We had one of our friends from small group stop by to meet our daughter.

We made 1 more outing to publix, target, and starbucks (we apparently cant go by there without stopping anymore).

Came back home, finished up, and had a fun rest of the evening.'

My daughter eerily started at me for about 15 minutes while i talked to her about career planning and then software development, shortly after reading her a star wars parody. Also good times.

I finished getting my web server back up, saw several more big smiles, tried out the quiet down techniques a couple more times (more on those later) and then at about 5:20 am, attempted to fall asleep.  That's in 3 minutes, so i'll talk with you again tomorrow.

God, It's been a whirlwind of a week.  Thanks for kkeeping me strong and stable.  I only hope that you'll continue to let me play the role of super dad while at the same time easing my fears about my daughter sleeping in her own room.  Thanks again for giving me the most amazing gift I've ever gotten.

Amen!
