				<h2>Day 4 - Chillaxed</h2>

				<hr />
				<p>Day 4 started out the way I had imagined my baby PTO time would.  Sleep in, serve my wife and daughter, run the house, and just enjoy being a family.  I got to start <!--more-->playing the new father role for real.  I was able to hold my daughter again on my chest while she was sleeping for another 2 or 3 hours.  I slept in late, and got to really enjoy my time with her.  The only scary part was that when I woke up, she was in the crook of my right arm.  She's a wiggler.  I keep calling her daddy's little wiggle worm.  The problem is, I sleep almost at the edge of the right side of the bed.  Had she gone any further without me waking up, she could have rolled off of my bed.  Not what I had planned for day 4.  Thankfully she did not.  My wife woke me up and put her back on to my chest.  I managed to put a blanket over her on top of me to help prevent her from wiggling that far.  Even still she managed to wiggle the top of her body all the way from next to my neck down to the crook of my left arm.  She's a mover.

I can definitely say it's amazing seeing the small developments and picking up on the cues.  I look at her, see her sucking on her hand, opening her mouth, opening and closing her hands, and beginning to cry and realize that she is relying on an instinct that newborns have to signal that they are hungry.  It's so much fun to play with the reflex that newborns have that makes their hands close around your finger.  It makes me feel like she is connecting with me.  I love watching he snoozing after feeding for a while and seeing her make faces.  I dont know whether she is dreaming or whether they are natural pieces of personality built in or whether there is a biological reason for it. 

Whatever spell this little girl has put me under, it's definitely working.  I am in love.  I would do anything for my family.  Her life and the love my wife gives her are the only things I need to want to be a better man.  The fact that Jesus loves me like that and God loves me like I love my daughter just blows my mind.  It's all been a whirlwind, but I look forward to all of the good times to come.

Thank you God for everything.  I spend all this time thanking you, but there's just so much to be thankful for.  Wow.  Who would have thought that being a parent would feel like this.  Its just crazy.

Amen
