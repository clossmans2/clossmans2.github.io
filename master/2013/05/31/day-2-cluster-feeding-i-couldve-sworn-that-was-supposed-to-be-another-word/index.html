				<p>a little on the unexpected side of things, night number 2 was definitely rougher than night one.My daughter began <!--more--> her cluster feeding time period and things got crazy.  in short, it was so rough that i didnt have time to post until now.  For those uninitiated or unaware, cluster feeding is where the baby finally realizes what true hunger is and feeds almost continuously for long periods of time because it cant get satisfied on the collostrum that is being produced by the mother at that point.  

For us, this translated into a night full of work with our daughter.  My job was to hold the baby's hand as mom helped her get latched on, and then to record the time, position, length of feed, diaper contents, skin to skin time, and anything else pertinent.  im not a record keeper by nature so this was a challenging task that i dove head first into.  From 10am to 5am with a few 10-20 minute breaks, my daughter fed near continuously.  I am positive that it was nowhere near as rough for me as it was for my wife.  She is a serious trooper.  The baby just kept at it.  At certain points it was like that baby just felt comfortable in the breast feeding position and would fall asleep.  But when I asked if she was asleep ( so i could put her back in the bassinet to let mommy get some rest, the baby would keep on sucking).

Whether it was exhaustion from the day before or my insistence to do anything I could for my wife, at about 4:15am i started feeling dizzy, lightheaded and nauseous.  I lay down for about 30 minutes.  when i awoke, An hour had passed and the doctor had already come in to check on us.  Mom showed me that my girl was finally so tired that she passed out and then placed her on my chest.

My daughter laid there sleeping atop my proud bosom (getting all 19th century lit there) for about 4 or 5 hours.  It was the most relaxing and rewarding time i'd had with my daughter since she'd been born.  I think Im in love already.  I hope the craziness doesnt last too long.   That may start taxing on daddy's sanity before too long.  But with the way that I feel about her and my wife now, Id give up any shred of sanity I have left to be with them.

This entire experience reminds me of 2-a-day football practice before high school started for me in 2003-2004.  Those days kicked my rear end.  But the end came quicker than I ever believed it would and I think about the benefit of it for me and the teammates around me.  We were battered, bruised, beaten up, and fatigued further than anything Id ever been through before, but in the end I remember the sense of pride i had for my team and the ownership we all took in its success due to  our shared suffering.  Ill never forget those days, and as long as I continue this writing, I know ill never forget these days Im traversing now.  Great memories are being forged and Im first string in the Dad position this year.

Thank you God for giving me this opportunity to serve my wofe and daughter during these formulary moments.  Please keep me strong, energized, and humble as we move forward together.

Amen!
