				<p>Wow!  It's been a heck of a day. Lets recap.

Finish writing day 0 blog at 3;30 am and  fall asleep.  
<ul>

<li>8:00 AM : I'm awoken by my younger brother coming into the room along with my parents.  I find out that earlier that morning while I slept,<!--more-->
 they manually broke her water. Pitocin drip starts, and my wide is 3cm dilated.</li>

<li>1:15pm, she's now at 5 cm and the contractions are starting to hurt.  She gets her epidural.</li>

<li>9:45pm still waiting on the baby to turn to the correct side.  </li>

<li>10:30pm - OB makes executive decision that the baby wont turn correctly without complicating things and that the only way to do this was through C-section.  My wife is panicking because this is the first real surgery shes ever had.</li>


<li>11:10pm - we walk out of the room and down the hall after i donned my blue scrubs and mask.  they make me wait outside the O.R. while prep and anesthesia occurs.</li>


<li>11:20pm - my wife is holding my hand on the operating table. the experience is just about mortifying.  i hear the anesthetist tell us that shes going to feel pressure on her chest like an elephant sitting on her.  We tell her it will all be ok.</li>


<li>11:21pm - we hear a cry let out on the other side of the sheet.  our baby girl is here.  i peak around the curtains and catch a small glimpse.  of my newborn daughter.  i see the doctors crowd around her as they inspect her.</li>


<li>11:31pm - they hand me my baby girl, and although she's a bit different than what i expected, i cant help but choke up at the sheer beauty of her.  "that's mine" i thought.  i follow her to the nursery and through the crowd my family created on the way to the nursery.</li>

<li>12:05am - ive been videoing ever since i went into the OR and followed my daughter to the nursery taking pictures with one hand, rolling video with the other.  they wash her in a seriously hard manner and then dry her and put her under a warmer.  she heats up pretty quickly.  by the time shes warm ive taken over 45 pictures and 30 minutes of video.  another baby comes in to the nursery and im instantly kicked out.</li>

<li>1:35am -Time drifts on for a while as we wait for my wife to come back from the OR when finally ahe arrives, a bit sleepy from the anesthetic.  within 10 minutes the baby is brought to us from the nursery, mom finally gets to hold her baby.  Im starving because i havent eaten since lunch time of the previous day of waiting. I search for places still open and hit only restaurants across town.  i end up eating some tuna and crackers i packed in my snack bag.  not great but enough to get by</li>

<li>3:49am - my wife attempts to breast feed our child for the first time and finds a bit of success.  that was a lot easier than we thought.  i finish organizing the room, put my bed together and lay down to try to blog.  its 4:08am.  i tried posting this twice already and keep ending up with a couple of long key presses that happen when i doze offfffffffffff mid sentence.  anyways, its been a long day and im crashing so peace out.</li>

</ul>
